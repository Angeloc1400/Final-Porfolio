#This program lets the user choose its numbers for the pythagorean theorem equation
import math
print("here is the equation of pythagorean theorem c= âˆš(a^2+b^2)")
a=int(input("What number do you want A to represent "))
b=int(input("What number do you want B to represent"))

equation=math.sqrt(math.pow(a,2)+math.pow(b,2))

print("Your pythagoream theorem is", equation)
